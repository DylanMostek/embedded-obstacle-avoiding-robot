# Embedded Obstacle Avoiding Robot (CSCE 336)

Arduino based robot that drives forward and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic distance sensor.
Uses PWM for motor speed and a servo mounted sensor head to scan and choose a clear direction.
Firmware is modularized into reusable libraries for motor control and sensor head control.
